 Dynamic Pricing System for Ride-Sharing Platform

Developed a dynamic pricing system integrated into a fully functional web application for a ride-sharing platform. The project uses advanced analytics and algorithms to adjust ride prices in real-time based on various factors such as demand, supply, and ride duration. This system aims to optimize revenue for drivers and provide competitive pricing for users.

**Methodology:**  
- **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:** Implemented a pricing algorithm that calculates adjusted ride costs using factors like the number of active drivers, the number of riders, and historical ride costs.
- **Demand and Supply Multipliers:** Calculated demand and supply multipliers using statistical methods (percentiles) to adjust prices dynamically.
- **Profitability Analysis:** Analyzed profitability by comparing adjusted ride costs to historical costs, identifying rides that are profitable versus those incurring a loss.

**Results:**  
- **Optimized Revenue:** The dynamic pricing model effectively balances supply and demand, potentially leading to increased revenue during high-demand periods.
- **Improved User Engagement:** By offering competitive pricing, the system improves user engagement and reduces the likelihood of users abandoning the ride-sharing service.
- **Scalability:** The architecture supports scaling to accommodate more users and additional features, such as incorporating more complex data points like traffic conditions and weather.

**Website Features:**
- **Frontend (React):** Developed a user-friendly frontend interface using React. The interface allows users to input ride details, view adjusted prices in real-time, and access historical ride data visualizations.
- **Backend (Flask):** Built a RESTful API using Flask to handle requests from the frontend, apply the dynamic pricing logic, and return calculated prices.
- **Deployment:** Deployed the web application on platforms like Heroku (backend) and Netlify (frontend) to ensure accessibility and scalability.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** React, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Axios
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, NumPy, Pandas
- **Deployment:** Heroku (backend), Netlify (frontend)
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database (Optional for storing historical data):** MongoDB or SQL database

**Impact:**
- **Increased Profitability:** Implemented a dynamic pricing strategy that resulted in better utilization of resources and increased profitability.
- **Scalability:** The project is scalable, allowing for future enhancements and integration with more complex data points, such as real-time traffic data and user behavior analytics.

This project demonstrates the ability to develop and deploy a full-stack application using modern web technologies and data analytics, showcasing both technical proficiency and business acumen.
